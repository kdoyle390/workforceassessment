# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# organizations = Organization.create([{name: "Paddy's Pub", hourly_rate: 3.25}, {name: "Bluth's Original Frozen Banana", hourly_rate: 11.50}, {name: "Bob's Burgers", hourly_rate: 25.75}])
